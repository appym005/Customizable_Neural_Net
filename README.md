# Customizable_Neural_Net
This is a customizable neural network. The users can set the training data according to their needs and also train according to their needs. It currentlty has only one neuron but work is in progress.

If you wish to customize a neural net by adding custom inputs and outputs, run simple_neural_net.py .
If you wish to test a model on custom inputs, run neural_net_interface.py .
inputs.txt -> File that contains all the training inputs.
outputs.txt -> File that contains all training outputs.
weights.txt -> File that contains the weights after training.
